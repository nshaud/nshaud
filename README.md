I'm Nicolas Audebert (*he/him*), PhD, junior research director in Artificial Intelligence.
In short, I am a computer scientist and computer vision/machine learning researcher.

Most of the time, you can find me at work at the French [National Institute of Geographical and Forest Information](https://www.ign.fr/institut/identity-card) (IGN) in the [LASTIG](https://www.umr-lastig.fr/) laboratory, just outside of the French capital.
I lead a research project on the design and application of better generative models for Earth Observation data.

I was previously an associate professor at [Conservatoire national des arts et métiers](https://www.cnam.eu/presentation/) and am currently on leave from this position.

## 🔭 What do I do

* My work deals with learning effective representations of images and signals so that computers can process them efficiently for high-level tasks.
* I focus on *computer vision* using *deep learning* approaches, although I also dabble in applications of machine learning for games.
* Most of the applications I am currently interested in are related to Earth Observation and satellite imagery: how can we become better and faster at mapping the planet?

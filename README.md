I'm Nicolas Audebert (*he/him*), PhD, associate professor of computer science and computer vision/machine learning researcher. Most of the time, you can find me at work in of the beautiful buildings of [Conservatoire national des arts et métiers](https://www.cnam.eu/presentation/) in the French capital.

## 🔭 What do I do

* My work deals with learning effective representations of images and signals so that computers can process them efficiently for high-level tasks.
* I focus on *computer vision* using *deep learning* approaches, although I also dabble in applications of machine learning for games.
* Most of the applications I am currently interested in are related to Earth Observation and satellite imagery: how can we become better and faster at mapping the planet?
